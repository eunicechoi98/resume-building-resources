tips on UX Design skills description (copied from #1 above) :
Be descriptive! Good examples:
Sketch — this is my primary design tool. I know how to use symbols and plugins. The plugin I use most is Craft. I use shared styles for colors, gradients and fonts.

Axure — I know how to make a sticky header that appears on scroll and how to display different copy as an error state of a text input. I use dynamic panels.

Principle — I can design very basic interactions such as vertical and horizontal scrolling or a change of button style on hover.

Good examples:
I know what is progressive disclosure and why it is wrong to display too much of information on one screen.

I have used such techniques as guerilla usability testing and affinity diagraming in my school projects.

Do not say you are master of Sketch. Prove it by saying you know how to make RWD designs with only one artboard. Then be ready to explain the recruiters how to do it.

#5 Decribe what was the biggest project that you did and prove you used professional knowledge for that
You are applying for a junior UX designer position, so nobody expects you to have a robust portfolio. Instead, better describe the biggest project that you did and attach a link to some mockups or a prototype.

Good example:
My biggest project so far was my graduation project. For my finals, I designed an e-commerce platform for artisans. I worked with data-driven approach and used real photos that I found on other platforms with user-generated content. I wanted to omit the problem with designing unrealistic UI that can be ruined with unprofessional images taken with a smartphone camera. I did paper prototypes, I designed wireframes in Sketch and created a hi-fidelity prototype in Axure.
